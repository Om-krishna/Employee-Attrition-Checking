 IT companies are doubling down on efforts to prevent young employees skilled in digital technologies – and other high-performers — from jumping ship, as they grapple with rising attrition rates.

In the April-June period, several leading IT players including Infosys, Wipro and Cognizant reported higher attrition numbers. For Cognizant, it jumped to 23% against 19% for January-March. Infosys reported 23.4% attrition (including people who were let go) compared to 20.4% in the preceding three months. (data for 2019)
The software services providers are looking to stem the talent outflow through better salary increases, promotions and bonuses for top talent, as well as overall employee value proposition, which includes career growth, and learning and reskilling .  

We want to develop a product which will help us understand the reason for this attrition and also try to predict who might leave the company so that we can take steps in advance to avoid them from leaving. In order to do that we have done our research and tried to see what kind of solutions are available and how we can better them. During our research we found a sample dataset on an open source.
